# Dementia Prediction

A machine learning pipeline for predicting dementia using the OASIS dataset, featuring:

- Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique to handle class imbalances

- Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) for hyperparameter tuning

- A Flask-based web application for real-time predictions
